A gene-level metagenomics oriented pipeline for the analysis of shotgun reads from microbial communities.

This pipeline uses sciluigi (customized fork running tasks in containers) to run software seamlessly 
on local computer resources (via docker), on private HPC clusters (using singularity), or on public clouds 
(e.g. AWS batch).
