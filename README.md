# GeneShot

A gene-level metagenomics oriented pipeline for the analysis of shotgun (WGS) reads from microbial communities.

This pipeline is implemented using the open-source workflow management system Nextflow. This workflow management
system is intended to run software seamlessly on local computer resources (via docker), on
private HPC clusters (using singularity), or on public clouds (e.g. AWS batch).
